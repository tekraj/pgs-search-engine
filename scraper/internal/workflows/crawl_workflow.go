// in-memory workflow state -- safe because workflow code executes as a
// single deterministic logical thread (Temporal replays it, it doesn't
// truly run it concurrently), so no locking is needed even though several
// ProcessPage activities are in flight at once.
//
// Failure handling is Temporal's job, not this file's: activity retries,
// backoff, and timeouts are configured once via ActivityOptions below, and
// Temporal persists workflow progress after every event, so a crashed or
// redeployed worker resumes an in-progress crawl (via replay) without
// losing the frontier or re-doing completed work.
