# Database (`pgs-db`)

We design and manage the PostgreSQL database that the scraper, ETL, search engine and API all share.

**Status: complete.** Every layer is built and migrated: Bronze, Silver, Gold, the reference
gazetteer with map boundaries, and the ops tables. Each service has its own database role, a
scheduled jobs runner loads the scraper's S3 output into Bronze and keeps Gold fresh, and CI
checks every migration from an empty database. What remains is for the other teams to connect
to it — see [§8](#8-connecting-the-other-teams).

---

## 1. What the database is for

The database is the project's **record book**. It does not hold the actual web pages. It holds **information about them**:

- which websites we crawl and their status
- which files were downloaded and where they are stored
- clean page details (title, language, date) and where in Nepal each page belongs
- what the map, the admin dashboard and search ranking read
- admin users, quarantined files, error logs and the search log

## 2. What goes where

| Data | Stored in |
|---|---|
| Raw HTML, PDFs, documents | **MinIO** (not the database) |
| Full page text for searching | **OpenSearch** (indexed from `search_documents`) |
| "Already visited" URL list | **Redis** |
| Records, status, relationships, locations, map shapes | **PostgreSQL (this group)** |

`crawled_documents.text` and `pages.body_text` are deliberate exceptions: they are the provenance
the index is built from, so a page can be re-indexed without re-fetching it. Search queries
OpenSearch, not these columns.

## 3. How data is organised

The ER diagram is in [`docs/erd.md`](docs/erd.md).

| Layer | Meaning | Tables |
|---|---|---|
| **Bronze** | Raw: every crawl and every downloaded file, unchanged | `crawl_runs`, `crawled_documents`, `stored_files` |
| **Silver** | Clean: one record per page, deduplicated, geo-tagged | `pages`, `page_geo_tags`, `page_contacts`, `page_sources`, `page_media`, `entities`, `page_entities`, `page_embeddings`, `quarantined_files` |
| **Gold** | Ready to use: summaries, ranking signals, the search log | `domain_stats`, `geo_content_stats`, `page_scores`, `search_queries`, `search_clicks`, `relevance_judgments`; views `search_documents`, `page_geo_codes` |
| **Reference** | What everything links to | `provinces` (7), `districts` (77), `local_bodies` (753) with boundaries and ward counts, `domains`, `region_links` |
| **Ops** | Running the system | `admin_users`, `error_logs` |

`search_documents` and `page_geo_codes` are **Gold views over Silver**: always current, nothing
to refresh. The Gold *tables* are rebuilt by the jobs in [§6](#6-scheduled-jobs).

### What each service uses

| Service | Role | Repository | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scraper (Go) | none (writes S3) | its S3 bucket, loaded by the `ingest` job (`pgs_db.ingest`) | — | — |
| Scraper, if it writes Postgres directly | `pgs_scraper` | `BronzeRepository` / [`scraper-db-contract.md`](docs/scraper-db-contract.md) | gazetteer, domains | Bronze, `domains` |
| ETL (Spark) | `pgs_etl` | `SilverRepository`, `pgs_db.etl` / [`bronze-silver-contract.md`](docs/bronze-silver-contract.md) | Bronze, gazetteer (`ReferenceRepository.gazetteer`, `locate`) | Silver |
| Search / indexer | `pgs_search` | `SearchRepository` | `search_documents`, `page_embeddings` | `pages` indexing state |
| API | `pgs_api` | `OpsRepository`, `StatsRepository`, `QuarantineRepository`, `ReferenceRepository`, `SearchLogRepository` | everything | admin tables, domains, quick links, search log, labels |
| Scheduled jobs | `pgs_jobs` | `python -m pgs_db.jobs` | everything but `admin_users` | Gold summaries, retention |
| Dashboards | `pgs_readonly` | — | everything but `admin_users` | nothing |

### API endpoints → repository methods

| Endpoint | Method |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth/login` | `OpsRepository.get_admin` (username or email) + `pgs_db.security.verify_password`, then `record_login` |
| `GET /user/search` | OpenSearch, then `SearchLogRepository.log_query`; `regional_card` from `ReferenceRepository.regional_card` |
| `GET /user/documents/download/{id}` | `SearchRepository.file_location` (None for quarantined files: answer 404) |
| `GET /user/geo/hierarchy` | `ReferenceRepository.hierarchy` |
| map shapes / colours | `ReferenceRepository.boundaries_geojson`, `StatsRepository.geo_content` |
| `GET /admin/dashboard/summary` | `StatsRepository.dashboard_summary`, `SearchLogRepository.traffic` |
| `GET /admin/domains`, `POST .../action` | `StatsRepository.list_domains`, `set_domain_status` |
| `GET /admin/storage/metrics` | `StatsRepository.storage_metrics` |
| `GET /admin/logs/errors` | `OpsRepository.list_errors` |
| `GET /admin/security/quarantine` | `QuarantineRepository.list_quarantined`, `mark_deleted` |
| health / readiness probe | `pgs_db.health.check` |

## 4. Design decisions worth knowing

- **Dedupe identity** is `UNIQUE (normalized_url, content_hash)` on `crawled_documents`: the same
  URL with changed content becomes a new row. Silver keys a page on its `canonical_url`.
- **Geo links use codes, not ids** (`P4`, `D38`, `MUN414`), the codes ETL and search already exchange.
- **Statuses are `VARCHAR` + `CHECK`**, not native enums, so Go and Spark insert plain strings.
  Values live in `src/pgs_db/enums.py`.
- **All primary keys are `BIGINT`**; **all timestamps are `timestamptz`** in UTC.
- **`updated_at` is kept by a trigger** on every table, so plain-SQL writers (Go, Spark) keep it
  honest too. An explicit new value is left alone.
- **Work queues** (`claim_bronze`, `claim_stored_files`, `claim_for_indexing`) use
  `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in a `MATERIALIZED` CTE: parallel workers never take the same row, and
  a claim never exceeds its `limit`.
- **Every foreign key is indexed** (a test enforces it), so deletes never scan a child table.
- **No personal data in the search log**: an opaque session id only, no IP, user agent or account.
- **Embeddings are per model**: `embedding_models` registers each model and its size (LaBSE,
  768, is the default); a composite foreign key keeps every vector the right size for its model,
  and each model has its own HNSW index. Documents and queries must use the same model.

**Note for the Go scraper:** `sim_hash` is `uint64` in Go but Postgres has no unsigned type. Write
`int64(simHash)` and read back with `uint64(v)`; the bits are unchanged.

## 5. Reference data

### The gazetteer

`data/nepal_geography.json` holds all 837 regions and is committed, so seeding needs no network.
Source: [sagautam5/local-states-nepal](https://github.com/sagautam5/local-states-nepal) — 6
metropolitan, 11 sub-metropolitan, 276 municipalities, 460 rural municipalities = 753.

**Codes are assigned by this project**, not taken from an official registry:

| Level | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Province | `P1`–`P7` | `P4` = Gandaki |
| District | `D01`–`D77` | `D38` = Kaski |
| Local body | `MUN001`–`MUN753` | `MUN414` = Pokhara Metropolitan City |

**This is the contract for `GeoLocation.district_code` and `municipality_id`.** (The API spec's
example `MUN75340` and the ETL README's `D39` for Kaski are illustrative; code against these.)

`local_bodies.phone` / `email` / `address` start empty; the `reference` job fills them from each
municipality's own website once it has been crawled. `region_links` (quick links on a region's
search card) is filled by admins.

### Map boundaries

`data/boundaries/*.geojson.gz` are Open Knowledge Nepal's current boundaries (CC BY 4.0,
[`ATTRIBUTION.md`](data/boundaries/ATTRIBUTION.md)), re-keyed to our codes by
`scripts/build_boundaries.py`, which refuses to write unless every province, district and local
body gets its shape. A test re-checks the mapping by geometry: every local body lies inside its
own district. **Any map showing them must credit "Boundaries © Open Knowledge Nepal, CC BY 4.0".**

The UI should load shapes from `ReferenceRepository.boundaries_geojson` instead of its own GeoJSON,
which predates the 2017 restructuring (75 districts; only 544 of 766 names match the gazetteer).

## 6. Scheduled jobs

Local and dev crawls (`--storage=ndjson`, the scraper's default) load with
`pgs_db.ingest.ingest_ndjson(Session, "documents.ndjson")`; production reads S3 through the
`ingest` job below.

`python -m pgs_db.jobs <job>` as the `pgs_jobs` role. Each job runs in its own transaction under
an advisory lock (an overlapping run skips), prints one JSON line, and exits non-zero on failure.

| Job | Does | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest` | load new runs and documents from the scraper's S3 bucket into Bronze | every 5 min |
| `stats` | rebuild `domain_stats`, `geo_content_stats` | every 15 min |
| `scores` | rebuild `page_scores` (PageRank, freshness, quality) and domain authority | hourly |
| `reference` | link domains to local bodies, fill missing municipality contacts | daily |
| `release-stale` | return ETL / indexing claims stuck > `--stale-minutes` (30) | every 10 min |
| `purge` | error logs older than `--error-days` (90), searches older than `--search-days` (365) | daily |

`pgs_db.health.check` reports Gold older than 6 hours as `degraded`, so a stopped scheduler shows up.

## 7. Running it

### Local development

Needs **Docker Desktop** (running) and **Python 3.11+**.

PostgreSQL runs in the repository-root `docker-compose.yml` (image: `./Dockerfile`, PostgreSQL 16 +
PostGIS + pgvector). Starting the stack also migrates and seeds the database: the one-shot
`db-migrate` service (`./migrate.Dockerfile`) runs `alembic upgrade head` and the seed scripts,
then `db-roles` sets the service roles' passwords from `.env` (and creates Airflow's and
Temporal's databases in the same server); the services start only after those succeed.

```bash
cp .env.example .env                  # in the repository root (Windows: copy)
docker compose up -d --build postgres db-migrate db-roles   # or the whole stack
cd database
pip install -e ".[postgres,dev]"

export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://pgs:pgs@localhost:5432/pgs
# Windows PowerShell: $env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://pgs:pgs@localhost:5432/pgs"

python -m alembic upgrade head        # all tables, views, triggers and roles (done by db-migrate)
python scripts/seed_geography.py      # 7 provinces, 77 districts, 753 local bodies (db-migrate)
python scripts/seed_boundaries.py     # their shapes (db-migrate)
python scripts/seed_domains.py        # the websites to crawl (db-migrate)
python -m pytest                      # 337 tests should pass
```

**The websites to crawl** are seeded from `data/domains.json` (9,761 rows of `domains`), which
`scripts/build_domains.py` builds from the scraper's seed list
(`scraper/configs/seeds.example.txt`) and the 753 local bodies' websites in
`data/nepal_geography.json`. One row per website (host without `www.`); categories and priorities
come from the seed list's sections. Each local government's site, and any subdomain of it, carries
its `local_body_code`, which the seed resolves to `domains.local_body_id`: the website's
geolocation (local body, and through it district and province), used to geo-tag its pages. The
seed only inserts new websites and fills empty `local_body_id` / `website_name`; status, priority
and anything else an admin changed are kept. After editing the seed list, re-run
`python scripts/build_domains.py` (`tests/test_domains_seed.py` checks the file is current).

The tests need a live, seeded database: they read `DATABASE_URL`, and each test runs in a
transaction that is rolled back. Without `DATABASE_URL` the suite skips rather than fails, so check
that tests actually ran. CI (`.github/workflows/database.yml`) runs all of this from an empty
database on every change under `database/`, plus a full downgrade and re-upgrade.

### Production deployment

1. **Migrate** as the schema owner: `python -m alembic upgrade head`. It enables `vector` and
   `postgis` and creates the six service roles (LOGIN, no password, with a `statement_timeout` each).
2. **Seed** (idempotent): `python scripts/seed_geography.py && python scripts/seed_boundaries.py`.
3. **Set a password per role**, per environment, from your secret store:
   `ALTER ROLE pgs_api PASSWORD '...'` (and `pgs_scraper`, `pgs_etl`, `pgs_search`, `pgs_jobs`,
   `pgs_readonly`). Each service connects as its own role.
4. **Create the first admin**: `pip install -e ".[postgres,auth]"`, then
   `python scripts/create_admin.py <username> --email <address>` (asks for the password; Argon2id).
5. **Point the loader at the scraper's bucket** (read-only credentials are enough) in the jobs'
   environment, with `pip install -e ".[postgres,s3]"`:
   `PGS_S3_BUCKET`, `PGS_S3_PREFIX` (the scraper's key prefix, if any), `PGS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`
   (MinIO; omit for AWS), and the usual `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` /
   `AWS_REGION`. Until `PGS_S3_BUCKET` is set, the `ingest` job reports "not configured".
6. **Schedule the jobs** in [§6](#6-scheduled-jobs), and point the API's readiness probe at
   `pgs_db.health.check`.
7. **Back up** with the platform's point-in-time recovery (WAL archiving), or at least a nightly
   `pg_dump -Fc`. Bronze is re-crawlable and Gold is rebuildable, so the tables that cannot be
   recreated are `admin_users`, `domains`, `region_links`, `relevance_judgments`, the search log
   and `quarantined_files` — make sure restores are tested for those.

Per-service connection settings: `DB_POOL_SIZE` (5), `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW` (10), `DB_POOL_RECYCLE`
(1800 s), `DB_APPLICATION_NAME` (shows in `pg_stat_activity`). Keep workers × (pool + overflow)
under the server's `max_connections`, or put PgBouncer in front.

### Changing the schema

Every change is an Alembic migration (`python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."`, then
review it). A migration that adds a table must also: add the `updated_at` trigger, add the table to
`pgs_db/grants.py` and call `grants.apply(op.execute)`, and bump `pgs_db.health.EXPECTED_REVISION`.
`tests/test_hardening.py` fails until all three are done.

A change to `crawl_runs`, `crawled_documents`, `stored_files` or `domains` must also re-export
`sql/scraper_schema.sql` (`python scripts/export_scraper_schema.py`), the DDL the Go scraper's
sqlc generates its models from, then `make sqlc` in `scraper/`. The scraper has no schema or
migrations of its own. `tests/test_scraper_schema_sync.py` fails while the file is stale or a
model disagrees with the migrated table.

**Common problems**

- **`alembic` / `pytest` not recognized:** use `python -m alembic` and `python -m pytest`.
- **`password authentication failed for user "pgs"`:** another PostgreSQL owns port 5432. Set
  `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` in the root `.env`, `docker compose up -d postgres`, and use 5433 in
  `DATABASE_URL`.
- **`extension "vector" is not available`:** the container is on the old PostGIS-only image. Run
  `docker compose up -d --build postgres` (repository root).
- **`column ... does not exist` although `alembic current` says head:** your database was built
  from an earlier draft of a migration. Recreate it (this deletes its data):
  `docker compose exec postgres psql -U pgs -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE pgs WITH (FORCE)" -c "CREATE DATABASE pgs"`,
  then migrate and seed again (`docker compose up db-migrate db-roles`).
- **Boundary tests skipped:** run `python scripts/seed_boundaries.py`.

**Connection URLs**

| Used by | URL |
|---|---|
| Python (SQLAlchemy, Alembic) | `postgresql+psycopg://<role>:<password>@<host>:5432/pgs` |
| Go scraper (`--storage=postgres`) | `postgres://pgs_scraper:<password>@<host>:5432/pgs` |
| Other containers in the root compose | host `postgres` instead of `localhost` |

## 8. Connecting the other teams

The database no longer waits on anyone, and it already accepts what each branch sends
today (checked against the branches on 2026-09-30, `tests/test_team_fit.py`). What is left
is on each team's side:

- **Scraper** (`oxfordoli/api-s3-rework`, `moni/s3-storage-data-integrity`): it is moving to
  S3-only storage, and that already works with us: the `ingest` job reads its bucket layout
  (`<run>/_run.json`, `<run>/<host>/<sha256(url)>.json`) into Bronze, run manifests included. All it has
  to give us is the bucket name, prefix and read-only credentials. Optional, for features that
  need it: put PDFs/images and contacts back in `Document` (PDF search, municipality contacts),
  and read `domains.status` so the admin's PAUSE / RESUME reach the crawler.
- **ETL** (`etl/workflow_saurav`): replace the JSONL / SQLite sink with one call per record,
  `pgs_db.etl.save_transformed(Session, record, geo_confidence=...)`, as `pgs_etl`. Pass the
  page's Document JSON from S3 as `bronze_document=...` to save it to Bronze in the same
  transaction. Its
  `transform.py` output is accepted unchanged: top-level title, hex simhash, place-name geo
  (resolved through the gazetteer) and the 768-d LaBSE embedding. Its rule-based
  `resolve_geo` can later give way to `ReferenceRepository.gazetteer` (names) and `locate`
  (coordinates). Its intake scanner records hits with `SilverRepository.quarantine`, passing
  its reasons as `threat_signature` and its name as `scanner_engine`.
- **Search** (`pg_vector`, `bm25-opensearch-vectorsearch`, `rabin/grpc-search-service`):
  **embed queries with LaBSE** (`sentence-transformers/LaBSE`, 768-d) — documents are LaBSE
  now, and a MiniLM query vector cannot be compared with them. Replace
  `SELECT ... FROM documents` with `SearchRepository.vector_search`, which takes the proto's
  `SearchRequest` values as sent (`municipality_id`, `""`, ward `0`, `"all"`, `"auto"`). Index
  OpenSearch from `claim_for_indexing` (their `SearchDocument` shape) and finish each page with
  `SilverRepository.mark_processed`. Every exported document carries its location under both
  `geo` (Shreya's `SearchDocument`) and `geo_location` (Hishila's filter and region counts), so
  both work on one index as they are.
- **Image indexing** (`feat/image-ingestion`): send images as `media` items on their page
  (`alt_text`, `extracted_text` = OCR, `surrounding_context`), or as stored files; both land.
- **Reranker** (`rashik/lightGBM`, `niseta/lightgbm-reranker`): train on
  `SearchLogRepository.training_examples()` instead of the hand-made CSV; it supplies labels and
  the query-independent features (`freshness`, `source_authority`, `content_length`, ...).
- **API** (`baidehi/api-core-structure`): the table in [§3](#3-how-data-is-organised) maps each
  endpoint; downloads go through `SearchRepository.file_location` (never serves a quarantined
  file). The service filter values are upper case (`SCRAPER`, not `Scraper`).
- **UI** (`ui-new`, `ui-new-map`): replace `ui/public/data/nepal-*.geojson` with the output of
  `python scripts/export_boundaries.py ../ui/public/data`: current boundaries (77 districts)
  under the property names the map already reads, plus our codes; show the attribution. Later,
  log in through the API (email works) and colour the map from `geo_content`. Its `src/lib` folder
  is missing from the branch: the root `.gitignore`'s Python `lib/` rule hides it.
- **DevOps**: done in the repository-root `docker-compose.yml`: `database/`'s image, `alembic
  upgrade head` and both seed scripts (`db-migrate`) and a password per service role
  (`db-roles`) on every start; each service connects as its own role.

## 9. Rules everyone should follow

1. **Don't create or change tables yourself.** Ask the Database group; all changes go through migrations.
2. **Never store file contents in PostgreSQL.** Store the MinIO path instead.
3. **All times in UTC.**
4. **Use the fixed status values** in `src/pgs_db/enums.py`.
5. **Connect as your service's role**, never as the schema owner.
6. **Python services** use the package (`pip install -e ./database`, `import pgs_db`); **non-Python
   services** write the same tables with the statements our contracts publish.
