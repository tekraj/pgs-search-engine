# PGS Search Engine Core

Python search engine core for the PGS bilingual (English/Nepali) search backend.
Searches an OpenSearch index of Nepalese web pages using BM25 with fuzzy matching
and query-time normalization/expansion.

## Implemented Features

- **Language detection** for English, Nepali, mixed, and unknown queries
  (`detect_language` in `pgs_search/query/normalizer.py`).
- **Unicode and whitespace normalization** — NFC normalization and collapsing of
  runs of whitespace (`normalize_query`).
- **English lowercasing** — applied to Latin-script queries during normalization.
- **Place-name expansion** — English-to-Nepali and Nepali-to-English expansion
  using a fixed EN-NE place dictionary (`query/data/en_ne_places.json`), applied
  to the full normalized query and each of its tokens.
- **Romanized Nepali recognition** — common romanized Nepali words and place
  names are detected (`detect_language`).
- **Fuzzy/typo-tolerant BM25 matching** — a `multi_match` query with
  `fuzziness: "AUTO"` over title, description, and searchable text
  (`pgs_search/retrieval/lexical.py`).
- **English stemming** — NLTK `PorterStemmer` stems English Latin-script tokens;
  stemmed query added as an additional search variant (`lemmatize_query`).
- **Standalone query-vector generation** — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via
  `SentenceTransformer`, cached with `functools.lru_cache`
  (`pgs_search/query/embeddings.py`). Not yet integrated into retrieval.
- **Result processing** — duplicate-result removal and blank-query handling
  (blank queries return no results without contacting OpenSearch).

## Known Limitations / Out of Scope

- **Translation is not implemented.** There is no general English-Nepali machine
  translation; only a fixed place-name dictionary is used for expansion.
- **Nepali lemmatization is not implemented.** The stemmer is English-only and
  leaves Devanagari tokens untouched; Nepali morphological analysis is out of
  scope.
- **Semantic reranking is not integrated.** Query vectors can be generated but
  are not wired into search/reranking; that belongs to a separate task.
- **Live BM25 search requires OpenSearch** to be running and reachable at the
  configured host/port/index (see `pgs_search/config.py`).
- **The first embedding call may download** the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  sentence-transformer model from Hugging Face.
