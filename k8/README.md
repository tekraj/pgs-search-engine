# Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests for the whole project, written with Kustomize (built into `kubectl`).
This is a **single-node, non-HA** setup: one replica of everything and ReadWriteOnce
volumes, aimed at Docker Desktop's Kubernetes. It runs the same services as the root
`docker-compose.yml`, with one difference: **Airflow uses the KubernetesExecutor, so every
DAG task runs in its own pod**.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (*Settings → Kubernetes → Enable Kubernetes*;
  with the kubeadm option, Kubernetes sees the images in the local Docker engine) and
  `kubectl` pointing at it: `kubectl config use-context docker-desktop`.
- The project images, built with Compose from the repository root:
  ```bash
  docker compose build                                  # default stack
  docker compose --profile scraper --profile search build   # images for the optional parts you enable
  ```
  They are tagged `pgs-search-engine/<name>:local` and used as is (`imagePullPolicy:
  IfNotPresent`). To use a registry instead, push them and set `images:` in
  `kustomization.yaml` and the task-pod image in `configmaps/airflow-pod-template.yaml`.
- Memory: the default stack requests ~4.6 GiB, plus up to 3 GiB per running Airflow task
  (LaBSE embeddings). Docker Desktop on WSL gets half the host RAM by default; raise it in
  `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` (`[wsl2]` `memory=12GB`) before enabling optional parts.

## Deploy

```bash
cp k8/secrets/secrets.env.example k8/secrets/secrets.env   # once; change the passwords
kubectl apply -k k8/
kubectl -n pgs-search-engine get pods -w
```

Start-up order is enforced with init containers instead of compose's `depends_on`: the
`db-bootstrap` Job migrates (Alembic), seeds and sets the service roles' passwords; the API and
search engine wait until they can log in as their role and see the seeded
data. Airflow's scheduler and webserver wait for `airflow-init` to migrate Airflow's own
database. The bootstrap Jobs delete themselves 10 minutes after finishing, so re-running
`kubectl apply -k k8/` (e.g. after rebuilding images with a new migration) runs them again.

Remove everything (volumes included): `kubectl delete -k k8/`.

## Airflow: DAG tasks as pods

| Object | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `airflow-scheduler` | Parses the DAGs and launches **one pod per task instance** from the pod template (`configmaps/airflow-pod-template.yaml`), through the Kubernetes API (`roles/airflow-pod-launcher.yaml`). It runs no tasks itself. |
| task pods (`app.kubernetes.io/name=airflow-task`) | The ETL image running `airflow tasks run ...`; they reach Kafka, ClamAV, OpenSearch and PostgreSQL by Service name. Deleted when the task succeeds, kept when it fails. |
| `airflow-webserver` | UI; reads task logs from the shared `airflow-logs` volume. |
| `airflow-db` | Airflow's metadata database. |

There is no Celery worker or Redis here. At most 4 task pods run at once
(`AIRFLOW__CORE__PARALLELISM`). DAGs are baked into the ETL image: after changing a DAG,
`docker compose build airflow-scheduler` and
`kubectl -n pgs-search-engine rollout restart deploy/airflow-scheduler deploy/airflow-webserver`.

Run the ETL pipeline: with the `scraper` block enabled, each website whose crawl finishes
publishes one event to `scraped_files_topic`; `etl_ingestion_pipeline` picks the new events
up every 5 minutes and runs the PySpark pipeline (security scan, extraction, dedup,
embedding) once per site.

```bash
kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080:8080
# http://localhost:8080 (login from secrets/secrets.env): etl_ingestion_pipeline runs
kubectl -n pgs-search-engine get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=airflow-task -w
kubectl create -f k8/jobs/on-demand/opensearch-indexer.yaml           # index the JSONL output
```

## Optional parts (compose profiles)

They are commented-out blocks at the end of `resources:` in `kustomization.yaml`: uncomment a
whole block, then `kubectl apply -k k8/`.

| Block | Adds |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | gRPC search engine (`search-engine:50051`), creating its OpenSearch index first |
| `scraper` | Temporal (+ its PostgreSQL and UI), LocalStack S3 (+ browser), headless Chrome, crawler worker, documents API |
| `scraper-sharded` | with `scraper`: three host-sharded workers (StatefulSet) instead of the worker Deployment; also uncomment the `patches:` block |
| `scraper-schedule` | with `scraper`: CronJob starting a crawl every 15 minutes (edit its seeds first) |
| `ui` | Next.js UI |
| `tools` | OpenSearch Dashboards |

One-off Jobs in `jobs/on-demand/` (`kubectl create -f`): `opensearch-indexer.yaml`,
`etl-spark-test.yaml`, and a crawl:
`SEEDS=https://example.gov.np envsubst < k8/jobs/on-demand/scraper-crawl.yaml.tmpl | kubectl create -f -`
(or `make k8s-crawl SEEDS=...` in `scraper/`).

## Access from the host

Every Service is ClusterIP (nothing is exposed outside the cluster); use port-forwards,
which bind to localhost:

| Service | Command |
| --- | --- |
| API | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/api 8000:8000` |
| Airflow | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080:8080` |
| PostgreSQL | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/postgres 5432:5432` |
| OpenSearch | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/opensearch 9200:9200` |
| Kafka (host scripts) | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/kafka 9092:9092` |
| UI | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/ui 3000:3000` |
| Temporal UI | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/temporal-ui 8233:8080` |
| Scraper API | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/scraper-api 8082:8080` (`/docs`) |
| S3 browser | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/s3-browser 8081:8080` |
| OpenSearch Dashboards | `kubectl -n pgs-search-engine port-forward svc/opensearch-dashboards 5601:5601` |

## Layout

Grouped by resource kind, one resource per file named after it (`services/api.yaml` is the
`api` Service, `deployments/api.yaml` its Deployment). `kustomization.yaml` lists every
file; a new resource goes into its kind's folder and into that list.

## Not covered (non-HA by design)

- No replication or failover: one PostgreSQL, Kafka, OpenSearch and Temporal each.
- Shared volumes (`airflow-logs`, `etl-processed`, `etl-models`) rely on all pods being on
  one node; on a multi-node cluster use a ReadWriteMany storage class or remote task logs.
- No Ingress, NetworkPolicies, autoscaling or backups. The PostgreSQL schema stays owned by
  the `pgs-db` migrations; the scraper has no migrations of its own.
